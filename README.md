# Chess_Data_Analysis
This is just a project where I am messing around with a dataset of chess games inorder to get some different insights from the data and to become more efficent with R and its different packages.


The Code Branch will hold the code for the data analysis.


The Plots Branch will hold some of the plots that will be produced.
